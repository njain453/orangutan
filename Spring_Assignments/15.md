# Spring Normal MVC Vs Spring Boot MVC

- Spring MVC, we have to specify Servlet Class, Controller Scope, bean xml file, views path etc. Basically we need to tell where to find Controller, where controller will find view, and which all libraries needed etc. 
But, in SpringBoot MVC lot of boilerplate is removed, and we don't have to do any internal configuration and just focus on writing actual code. 
  
- SpringBoot MVC reduces development time and increases productivity compared to Spring MVC
