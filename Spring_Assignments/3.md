#### 3) We have one class called Cars which has two variables int cc and String color. Write a program involving Spring which allows users to create only one object.

        <constructor-arg name="count" value='1'></constructor-arg>

```java
package com.example;

import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;

public class Test {
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
       ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("Beans.xml");
       Cars cr = (Cars) context.getBean("cars");
       cr.display();
       
       Cars cr1 = (Cars) context.getBean("cars");
       cr1.display();
       
       ((ClassPathXmlApplicationContext) context).close();

    }
}

```

Output:
```text
Value of count is 2
Color is Red
cc is 8
Color is Red
cc is 8

Note that using scope as "singleton" which is also default scope we have restricted bean definition to single instance per Spring Container. Hence even when two differnt objects created, constructor is called one time only.
