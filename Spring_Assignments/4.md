```java
package com.example;

import org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext;
import org.springframework.context.support.ClassPathXmlApplicationContext;

public class Test {
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
       ApplicationContext context = new ClassPathXmlApplicationContext("Beans.xml");
       Cars cr = (Cars) context.getBean("cars");
       cr.display();
       
       Cars cr1 = (Cars) context.getBean("cars");
       cr1.display();
       
       ((ClassPathXmlApplicationContext) context).close();

    }
}

```

Output:
```text
Value of count is 2
Color is Red
cc is 8
Value of count is 2
Color is Red
cc is 8

Note that when we changed scope to "prototype" it allows single bean definition to have any number of object instances. 
Since object instances are different hence constructor is called twice and two time Value of count is printed. 

 ```
