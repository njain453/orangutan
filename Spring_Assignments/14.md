```text

Autowiring - feature of Spring framwework in which Spring Container  will inject dependencies automatically. 

- it cant be used to inject primitive and string values. 
- it works with reference only. 

Autowiring can be done in 3 ways: XMl , Annotation 

In XML, it can be done in following ways:

- ByName: 

Spring Container  will search for bean based on name of the bean which need to be injected. So refeernce name and bean id defined should be same. 


- ByType

Spring Container  will search for bean based on type of bean class property so even if bean id won't match it will still be able to discover it.
